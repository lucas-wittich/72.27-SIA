# SIA-TP1

Implementation of a **Sokoban** game in Python with different search algorithms:

- Uninformed search: **DFS**, **BFS**
- Informed search: **Greedy**, **A\*** with two different heuristics

---

## How to Use

- `sokoban.py`  
  Play Sokoban manually using the **W A S D** keys

- `dfs.py`  
  Solve Sokoban using the **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithm

- `bfs.py`  
  Solve Sokoban using the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm

- `greedy.py`  
  Solve Sokoban with **Greedy Search**  
  Heuristics: **Manhattan Distance** and **Misplaced Pieces**

- `astar.py`  
  Solve Sokoban using the **A\*** algorithm  
  Heuristics: **Manhattan Distance** and **Misplaced Pieces**

- `main.py`  
  Runs several games with all the different algorithms and yields both plots and summaries of their performances.

## Notes

- The game uses **a single fixed board**, from Wikipedia.
